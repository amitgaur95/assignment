Data wrangling operations has been performed on the Google PlayStore app's datasets. Operations like:
  --> Reading dataframe in PySpark
  --> Exploratory data analysis
  --> Data manipulation
  --> Insights generation
Random forest regression ML model has been used for predition. Data cleaning and preprocessing has been performed on Category, Content Rating and Rating columns. With the use of RandomForestRegressor model from pyspark.ml.regression library, I have calculated Root Mean Square Error value that comes up to be 0.53. Hence, the value is closer to zero so can be considered as a good value.
